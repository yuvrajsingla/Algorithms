Given an array of n positive integers. 
Write a program to find the sum of maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the intgers in the subsequence
are sorted in increasing order.
For example, if input is {1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5}, then output should be 106 (1 + 2 + 3 + 100),
if the input array is {3, 4, 5, 10}, then output should be 22 (3 + 4 + 5 + 10) and if the input array is {10, 5, 4, 3},
then output should be 10
